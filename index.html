            <p>I am an avid equestrian and am building an app to resolve problems for people who show.
            will then use the profits to rescue horses from slaughter. I started my career creating Websites
                    and then fell into enterprise software sales. After something like 25 years doing that, which incidentally
                    is slightly less fun than sticking needles in your eyes, I am getting back to what I should have been doing
                    all along. The ability see your work's progress live as you work is so refreshing. In addition, the ability 
                    to control your destiny rather than rely on other people to keep their word is also refreshing. Now I am going
                    use this refound and newfound knowledge to create an app which solves many problems inherent in showing. If it's
                    successful, then the profits from it will be used to rescue horses from slaughter. </p>
